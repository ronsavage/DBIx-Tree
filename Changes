    - original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.91  Thu Aug 24 20:36:00 2000
    - added performance improvements, sorting, and bug fixes from
      Jan Mach <machj@ders.cz>
    - added limit and matching support from Ilia Lobsanov <ilia@lobsanov.com>

X.XX
    - active development begun by Aaron Mackey <amackey@virginia.edu>
    - DBIx::Tree project now hosted at SourceForge.net
    - $DBIx::Tree::VERSION now defined by CVS Revision tag; i.e. version
      numbers will change very quickly now - don't be alarmed.
    - added 'sth' and 'sql' alternatives to 'table' specification in
      new() constructor.
    - add 'post_method' callback option; now DBIx::Tree can make
      summary reports, as well as "worm" it's way around a tree
    - added various missing documentation.
    - deprecated tree() in favor of traverse()
    - added optional arguments start_id and threshold to new(),
      so that the traversal can be initiated at alternative subtree
      roots (by specifying different start_id's), and/or completely
      ignore levels higher than the threshold level.
    - removed the requirement for the user to run the do_query()
      method before we traverse the tree (Cleaner interface?)
    - allow traverse() to take a subset of the parameter hash that
      new() accepts, in order to provide locally modified traversal
      parameters (start_id, match_name, threshold, etc).
    - added tests for most of this new stuff.
    - added 'recursive' true/false flag argument to new/traverse;
      default is false, which provides the usual "get all the data,
      build the tree in memory and walk it" non-recursive traversal
      method.  A true value makes the traversal occur with minimal
      memory usage, but multiple database queries (to obtain the
      children of each node separately).  This is useful in cases
      where the tree is in fact very, very large, or when the user
      only wants to traverse certain smaller subtrees of the data (via
      the start_id argument to new/traverse).
    - added tests for 'limit' and 'recursive' arguments.

1.90 (bjepson)
    - added check for prerequisites in Makefile.PL.
    - changed default test to use DBD::mysql, since MySQL has become
      much more widespread than mSQL.
    - added message when test.pl ignores a DROP error.
